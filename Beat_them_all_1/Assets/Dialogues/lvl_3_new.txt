So how are we gonna beat them in Zhaan ? What did you find in this library ?
We're not going to Zhan. 
What?
We go straight to the center of the enemy camp and bring the fight to them
'Beg your pardon? Like a suicide mission?
Far from that, most of the enemy troops are on the big battlefield. That means their camp is undefended.
And what do we do once we are in their camp!? It's like to be inside a beehive!
Trust me on this, all we need is a miracle and we've got that.
 
Here is the plan, you go through the enemy force, and you make a mess. Mira and I will be right behind you. Do not stop until you get them all alright?
I'll do my best
See you in the beehive.
