Hi, so you're the one that helped Mira find me. Thank you
She told me you were our best chance to put an end to this war.
...I cannot assure the end result for I'm not the only pawn on this board but, I have a plan.

Do you know what is this place ?
A sort of Castle ?
It's the great library, where all the knowledge is kept. I spent three days here trying to find a way to beat the enemy
It seemed to be a pretty well defended hostile castle to me
Ha ha I guess it depends how you look at it
And did you find a way ?
The clock is ticking, I'll tell you everything while we walk
