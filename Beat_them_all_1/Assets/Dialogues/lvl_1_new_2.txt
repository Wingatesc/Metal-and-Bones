Hello, I'm looking for... a miracle ?
You just found it
It's you ? Why are you called like that ?
Stick around and you'll find out. If you're going to Zhaan it's this way. Good luck.
You're not coming ?
I have a little detour to take. Our Strategist and craftman Captain Brown went on a mission with no back ups
But... We are supposed to go to the battlefield
If we go without Brown I assure you we'll loose.
Like a side mission... Can I go with you?
Don't slow me down. Let's move.
