You're the first one to arrive, we're in a bit of a situation now, the plan has changed. I hope you'll be up to the task...
What's the mission chief?
Captain actually. Anyway this is a rescue mission. I'm gonna activate your equipment.
What's that?
You see the yellow icons at the bottom of your health? It's your ammunitions. Once you have one press T key and you will use your guns. You'll find ammunitions by exploring the areas. For this mission I dropped one for you.
I have guns? Cool! Could I have a sword too?
Yeah, We'll see about that later. Anyway, find our soldier and get her back to the base safe. Good luck mate.
