My hands to the King
And I will give you a sword in battle and a cup in victory
My eyes to the Queen
And I will show you a world with no fear to live in. Do we have news from the front?
Yes KingQueen, the troops are in Zhaan. We arrived just a little before the enemy and manage to secure a good position.
I should be there, fighting with our troops instead of hiding in our camp
If I may, it is exactly what they would want from you. A chance to slay you in battle. 
...
We should stick to the plan. Stay here in our camp where you are safe. I will go to the battlefield  and be your hands If you want to
No. I want you close Pamplemousse. Any word of captain Brown ?
He wasn't spotted on the battlefield yet, but this time even he will not be able to defeat our plans!
Where is he... we shouldn't underestimate him, double the number of guards and send more scouts. I want to know what he is up to.
Understood. Hands to battle KingQueen !
